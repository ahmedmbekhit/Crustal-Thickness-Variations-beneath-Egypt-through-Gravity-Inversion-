This repository contains code for processing satellite gravity data and performing gravity inversion to analyze the Moho boundary beneath Egypt. Our study focuses on quantifying the topography of the Moho, the contact between the lower crust and the uppermost mantle, and its relationship to thermal anomalies across the region.

The project unfolds in four main stages:
Data Adjustment: Integrating and adjusting gravity and seismic data to enhance accuracy.
Inversion Techniques: Implementing seismically constrained nonlinear inversion on Goco06s satellite gravity data to model the Mohoâ€™s topography, utilizing Bott's approach and Tikhonov regularization.

Our findings indicate significant variations in Moho depth, ranging from 35 to 39 km in the south, decreasing in the north and Mediterranean regions. The study reveals a correlation between Moho discontinuities and surface temperature anomalies, highlighting geothermal potential in central Egypt.

This repository includes the necessary scripts and documentation for replicating the analyses and visualizing the results. Contributions and collaborations are welcome!
